#### 10-07, 16:30â€“16:55 (US/Central), Track 1

This abstract explores the exciting intersection of AI and cybersecurity, showing how it can transform engineers into superheroes in the digital world. We delve into the awesome ways AI can level up your cybersecurity game, making you a 10x engineer.

This talk will be largely focused on an open source tool called "langchain". This tool simplifies the process of creating LLM applications. I will go over avenues of using LLM's and walk through examples on how everyday users can also use AI to be a force multiplier.

I'm an Infosec Practitioner with a love for automation. I'm well versed in most Cyber Operations, but my general area of focus is all things AppSec, and how an adversarial mindset can be used to reduce risk to the business.

I have a deep passion for learning and I enjoy working with others who share this passion.
